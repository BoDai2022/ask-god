Why ASK GOD?
"For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened" (Matthew 7:8 NIV).

If you're not a Christian, Have you ever thought about questions like:

Who are we?
Where are we from?
What are we living for if everyone dies?
If you identify yourself as a Christian, Do you still have questions like:

Shoud I attend a family member's same-gender wedding?
Do pets / animals go to Heaven? Do pets / animals have souls?
Will Jesus reign over Jerusalem again before revelation?
HOW IT WORKS?
Search a question you have.
If it's not here, Ask it.
A pastor on the platform will anwser it based on the Bible.
