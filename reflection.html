                It has really been a good journey along the way. Even though challenges keep coming up, I've kind of gotten used to it. More importantly, there are some key points I'd like to mention.
                Before taking this course, I underestimated the importance of the content of a website. I had thought about how the features should be delivered on the website, 
                but I didn't really pay much attention to gathering the exact materials that I could show, which directly led to a lack of ability to keep users sticky to the website. If I had done that
                beforehand, it would have been more natural to let the features follow the contents, thereby improving the efficiency on coding because of more tangible examples.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next thing I want to remind myself of is Human-computer interaction. As a programmer, I always was restrained by my own understanding of how a website should work, To put it another way,
                I just tried to use others' successful designs without thinking about the reasons why they're doing that. After taking the course, practicing, and getting feedback from others, I have a deeper 
                understanding of what a website is. It is not just about features, UI, it's more about humans; it's about how audiences feel, think, react and so on. Easier said than done, there're much to be
                learned in future. Of couse, other things like project management, code management, and other technical skills should be continually improved.
